# Primitive Data

Primitive are the base data type of every primitive hooks in `react-use-polygon`.

It defines what is the primitive, how it should look like and enable you to extend or utilize it in your programme.

## Using the data

**First**, create a primitive using provided hook:

```ts
const triangle = useTriangle();
```

Or for most of the time, you can use object destructuring to obtain the primitive data. If you are using multiple primitives, you can even rename them to avoid collision:

```ts
const triangle = useTriangle();

// or 
const { vertices: squareVertices } = useSquare();

const { vertices: penatgonVertices } = usePentagon();
```

Now, you can access the primitive data, i.e. `vertices`, `edges` and `faces` easily using the hook.

## Primitive properties

<PrimitiveReturns />

:::note

Don't worry about those properties, they may look intimidating at first, but they are very easy to understand.

:::

### Vertices

**`Vertex[]`**

Vertex is utterly the most important part when constructing a primitive in `react-use-polygon`. `vertices` is an array of all vertices of the primitive drawn. For example, a triangle will has three (3) vertices.

You may not need to use the vertices data when using `react-use-ploygon`, _which this is what we opt to (an easy API)_, but it is still good to know that vertex is defined as:

```ts
interface Vertex {
  x: number
  y: number
  z?: number
}
```

:::info

Currently, `z` is kind of being ignored due to the fact that we only expose 2D api.

However, in future we wish to add more complex 3D primitives to this library if possible.

:::

### Edges

**`Edge[]`**

An edge of a polygon or a segment of a primitive. It can either be a line, curve or an arc where connected by 2 vertices of that primitives.

Edge is composed of 3 main types: `LineSegment`, `CurveSegment` and `ArcSegment`:

```ts
/**
 * A straight line segment that joins 2 or more vertices.
 */
export interface LineSegment {
  type: "line";
  start: Vertex;
  end: Vertex;
}

/**
 * A curve segment that joins 2 or more vertices.
 *
 * This is a cubic bezier curve which start, c1, c2 and end will
 * be the 4 control points of the curve.
 *
 * Imagine it is a C shorthand in svg path.
 */
export interface CurveSegment {
  type: "curve";
  start: Vertex;
  c1: Vertex;
  c2: Vertex;
  end: Vertex;
}

/**
 * A portion of circular path of a circle.
 */
export interface ArcSegment {
  type: "arc";
  start: Vertex;
  end: Vertex;
  radius: number;
  angle: number;
}

/**
 * Either be a line, curve or arc.
 */
export type Edge = LineSegment | CurveSegment | ArcSegment;
```

:::info

Most of the times, you will not need to use edges directly, other than rendering the primitive.

We also try to provide built-in utility hooks and helper function built-in to let use process the primitive, without you to work on lower API yourself.

:::

### Faces

**`Face[]`**

Faces are enclosed surfaces formed by `edges` of the primitive. They are an array of `Edge`:

```ts
/**
 * Multiple edges combine that create a closed surface will form a face.
 */
export type Face = Edge[];
```

Again, like Edges, you're unlikely to use `faces` directly - it will more than likely be passed to a utility hook or helper function to get what you actually needed.

:::note

Currently, all hooks will only return at most one face as we only expose 2D primitve. Some primitive does not evenly has a face, even though they should for rendering perspective, but they may not make great mathematical sense.

Hence, this may introduce culprits where the faces generated may not be what you expected.

:::

### Bounding Box

**`BoundingBox`**

It define the boundary or the dimension of the 2D primitive in a rectangular box.

```ts
/**
 * 2D boundary of the primitive in a rectangular box.
 */
export interface BoundingBox {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
}
```

This property can help you to rendering or visualize the primitives. For example,

```tsx
const { boundingBox } = useRectangle({ width: 100, height: 50 })

// boundingBox of that rectangle will be
{
  x: -50,    
  y: 50,    
  width: 100,    
  height: 50,    
}
```

In which, the `x` and `y` tell you the starting point of the drawing box and its respective `width` and `height` in a 2D spaces.

:::info

You may find it odd that the starting point of the box is from negative area. The reason is because the origin of drawing is _(0, 0)_ on the grid, hence, the left hand side of the primitive will be on the negative plane.

:::

:::note

For **n-sides regular polygon** and circle related primitives, i.e. arc, sector, segment, it is first drawn from right and progress counterclosk-wise.

**NOTE**: First drawn point mentioned here is **not** origin, but rather where the first point is plotted. Origin is always _(0, 0)_, even with `position` configuration, we only translate the primitive after drawn.

:::

### modifyConfig

**`(newConfig: Partial<T>) => void`**

It is a callback the allow you to update the configurations of the primitive. The `T` is the repective config type of the primitive, i.e. `useCircle` -> `CircleConfig`, `useTriangle` -> `NRegularPolygonConfig`.

```ts
const { modifyConfig } = useTriangle({ size: 100 });

// Move the triangle around
modifyConfig({ position: { x: 20, y: 50 } });
```

You no need to pass every configurations into the callback, just the value that changed only. Other values will remains unchanged.

### Other properties

For `svgPath` and `drawOnCanvas`, please view [rendering primitives](/docs/getting-started/rendering-primitives).

:::tip For TypeScript lover

All the types that you may needed for your TypeScript project can be imported directly from `react-use-polygon`.
