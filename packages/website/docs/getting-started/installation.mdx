# Getting Started

## What is react-use-polygon?

`react-use-polygon` is a collection of react hooks and utilities functions that help you to create geometry shapes, primitives and polygon.
This package aims to provide a great developer experience and super simple api.
As such, we want to keeps our package as light weight as possible too.

We only generate the required geometry primitive for you to work on anything you want.
We want to give you the maximum flexibility on how to display/render your own polygon.

**As simple as this**:

```tsx
import { useTriangle, BasicSVGRenderer } from "react-use-polygon";

export function Triangle() {
  const triangle = useTriangle({ size: 100, rotation: 45 });

  return (
    <BasicSVGRenderer primitive={triangle} />
  )
}
```

**Outcome:**

## Installtion

<Tabs groupId="packageManager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npm install react-use-polygon</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">yarn add react-use-polygon</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pnpm add react-use-polygon</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

`react-use-polygon` is a standalone package and does not have any dependencies. :tada:

### What you'll need

_a.k.a. peer dependencies_

- `react` >= 18
- `react-dom` >= 18

For `react` and `react-dom`, it should be fine with hooks version and above, i.e. `v16.8`.
But this package is developed and tested with newer version.

:::note

We had added `"useClient";` tag on top of every client side components.
So, you can safely use it in `rsc` or `nextjs`.
