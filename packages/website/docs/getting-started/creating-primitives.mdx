# Creating Primitives

Primitives in `react-use-polygon` not only just having polygon like: triangle, square, pentagon. They also include circle, curves and other shapes as well.

We allow multiples ways to create a primitives, below will walk you through some of the basics to work with them.

## Basic usage

All primitives have their respective react hooks that can be easily consumed by your functional component.

Below will create a triangle primitive. You can pass in configurations to customize the primitive:

```ts
const triangle = useTriangle();

// or define the triangle size
const triangle = useTriangle({
  size: 100,
});
```

With that configuration, a triangle that inscribe in a circle of diameter 100 unit will be created.


:::tip

Don't worry about the configurations for now, most hooks will have default value(s) for them. If you're interested, you can find their configurations in their respective pages below.

Regarding the unit drawn, it will depends on how you wished to render the primitive, i.e. using svg path, the unit will be pixels.

## Regular Polygons

Regular polygons are the simplest types of primitive, where every sides has the same length and every vertices spread out evenly from the origin. 
For example, a pentagon has 5 sides, each sides has the same length and each vertices is spread out by 72 degrees from the origin.

You can define the dimension of a polygon using `size` _(which will be inscribed in an imaginary circle with that diameter)_, or the length of each sides using `sideLength`:

```ts
const hexagon = useHexagon({
  size: 100,
  // or
  sideLength: 100, // Note these 2 will not return the same results
});
```

We had prepared you with multiple pre-made regular polygons from 3 to 8 sides, which are: `useTriangle`, `useSquare`, `usePentagon`, `useHexagon`, `useHeptagon` and `useOctagon`.
Of course, you can create a n-sided regular polygon yourself, by calling `usePolygon` and passing in the number of sides you want:

```ts
// A nanogon
const nonagon = usePolygon({
    sides: 9,
});
```

## Irregular Polygons

Irregular polygons are normally more complex polygon. They can have differences side lengths and different angles among vertices. 
You can create your own irregular polygon by using `vertices` props with `usePolygon`:

```ts
const rightAngledTriangle = usePolygon({
    vertices: [
        { x: 0, y: -40 },
        { x: 30, y: 0 },
        { x: 0, y: 0 },
    ],
});
```

## Other primitives

Not just the polygon, we also have various geometry primitives and other _"shapes"_, such as: `useArc`, `useSector`, `useSegment` and more. Head to the primitives section to find out more.

## Common Configurations

All primitives share a common set of configuration properties, such as `position`, `rotation` and `scale`:

```ts
const triangle = useTriangle({
    side: 100, 
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 }, 
    rotation: 45, 
    scale: 2,
})
```

You can consider them as transformation **_after them being drawn_**, where `position` can be considered as `transform: translate` of css to the primitive.

The polygon will first be scaled, then rotated and lastly, translated.

### Reactivity

Currently, these configurations are being _snapshotted_ on mount for performance concerns. You can use the `modifyConfig` callback of the primitive to update the configurations:

```ts
const triangle = useTriangle({
    size, 
    position, 
    rotation, 
    scale
})

// Any updates happens, only need to pass in configs that changed
triangle.modifyConfig({ position, rotation, scale });
```

We hope to make all of those configurations becom fully reactivity, so you can animated by much easier without the need of using another callback.
