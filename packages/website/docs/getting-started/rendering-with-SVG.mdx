# Rendering Primitives

After all, you need to utilize the primitive created and rendering them out is definitely **the thing**.
Unlike other frontend UI library, `react-use-polygon` **does not** render the primitive to UI directly for you. Or locked you into using their rendering method only.

`react-use-polygon` instead wishes to give you the flexibility by provide you minimum-opinionated [primitive data](/docs/getting-started/primitive-data#primitive-properties).
To smoothen the process, you can utilize the primitive properties, includes: `svgPath`, `drawOnCanvas` and `boundingBox`.

## Rendering with SVG

One of the most simplest way to visualize the primitives or even any other shapes on web is through svg image.
Hence, `svgPath` and `boundingBox` properties of the primitive come in handy.

### svgPath

**`string`**

As the name tells, it is a string representing a svg path and can be easily pass in as props for a `path` element.

```tsx
const { svgPath } = useCircle();

return (
  <svg>
    <path d={svgPath} />
  </svg>
);
```

However, you may face a weird issue, which the primitive is not being rendered completely.
The reason is simple, because the primitive is being drawn on origin _(0, 0)_ and some part may end up in the negative plane, [see more details](/docs/getting-started/primitive-data#bounding-box).

You can either:

1. Set the svg style to `overflow: visible` _**(not recommended)**_.
2. Use `boundingBox` as the `viewBox` property of svg element.
3. Clip entire polygon onto positive plane.
4. Use a simple svg renderer.

Apart from 1, which we not recommend, 2, 3 and 4 can be done easily yourself, or using our built-in utilities.

#### Create svg `viewBox` from `boundingBox`

You can transform a primitive `boundingBox` to svg `viewBox` by:

```tsx
const { x, y, width, height } = boundingBox;

// Can be used as <svg viewBox={viewBox} ...
const viewBox = `${x} ${y} ${width} ${height}`;
```

You can convert the above to a function or use our built-in hook:

```tsx
import { useSquare, useSVGViewBox } from "react-use-polygon";

const { boundingBox } = useSquare();

const viewBox = useSVGViewBox({ boundingBox });

<svg viewBox={viewBox} />;
```

or helper function:

```tsx
import { computeSVGViewBox } from "react-use-polygon";

<svg viewBox={computeSVGViewBox({ boundingBox })} />;
```

:::tip

Rather than pass in the props as `{ boundingBox }`, you can pass in primitive or even an array or primitives as well.

```tsx
const reactangle = useRectangle();
const circle = useCircle({ position: { x: 50, y: 50 } });

// Directly pass in primitive
const viewBox = useSVGViewBox(reactangle);

// Or multiple primitives
const combinedViewBox = useSVGViewBox([reactangle, circle]);
```

Passing in an array is very helpful when you wish to render **multiple** primitive paths inside one svg element.

:::

:::info

`boundingBox` of primitive does not take into account of line stroke. Hence, when converted to svg `viewBox`, line stroke may only be partially shown.

To fix this issue, you can utilize `padding` props in those function, which will make the box larger to accomodate the line stroke of svg path.

Please refer [useSVGViewBox](/docs/utility-hooks/useSVGViewBox).

#### Clip entire polygon onto positive plane

Another way is to clip the entire primitive _(or at least the interested part)_ onto the positive plane by using `position` configurations. For example,

**Before:**

```tsx
import { useCircle } from "react-use-polygon";

// viewBox: "-100 -100 200 200"
const circle = useCircle({ radius: 100 });
```

**After:**

```tsx
import { useCircle } from "react-use-polygon";

// viewBox: "0 0 200 200"
const circle = useCircle({ radius: 100, position: { x: 100, y: 100 } });
```

As you can see that, adding a `position` config can move the polygon to you desired location on the plane.

You can even hide part of the faces by moving them to negative plane if you don't want to show on the negative part in the `viewBox`.

#### Use a simple svg renderer

You can create your own rendering component or use one of our built-in svg renderes.

```tsx
import { usePolygon, BasicSVGRenderer } from "react-use-polygon";

export function MyComponent() {
  const triangle = usePolygon({ sides: 3 });
  const square = usePolygon({ sides: 4 });
  const pentagon = usePolygon({ sides: 5 });

  return (
    <BasicSVGRender
      className="MyComponent"
      primitives={[triangle, square, pentagon]} // You can put it one or an array of primitives
      pathProps={{ fill: "blue", stroke: "red", strokeWidth: 2 }} // Path props
      viewBoxOptions={{ padding: 8 }}
      // ... other SVG props
    />
  );
}
```

:::note

Built-in renderers are very simple component that help you getting started easier. You don't even need to use them too.
