# Rendering Primitives

After all, you need to utilize the primitive created and rendering them out is definitely **the thing**.
Unlike other frontend UI library, `react-use-polygon` **does not** render the primitive to UI directly for you. Or locked you into using their rendering method only.

`react-use-polygon` instead wishes to give you the flexibility by provide you minimum-opinionated [primitive data](/docs/getting-started/primitive-data#primitive-properties). 
So, it is totally up to you on how you wisht o render it. This can help us to keep this package as lightweight s possible.

Despite that, it is often time better to visualize them easily and we do provide some utilities hooks or helper functions for easy rendering of primitives.
To smoothen the process, you can utilize the primitive properties, includes: `svgPath`, `drawOnCanvas` and `boundingBox`.

## Render with SVG

One of the most simpole way to visualize the primitives or even any other shapes on web is through svg image. Hence, `svgPath` and `boundingBox` properties of the primitive come in handy. 

### svgPath

**`string`**

As the name tells, it is a string representing a svg path and can be easily pass in as props for a `path` element.

```tsx
const { svgPath } = useCircle();

return (
  <svg>
    <path d={svgPath} />
  </svg>
);
```

However, you may face a weird issue, which the primitive is not being rendered completely. 
The reason is simple, because the primitive is being drawn on origin _(0, 0)_ and some part may end up in the negative plane, [see more details](/docs/getting-started/primitive-data#bounding-box). 

You can either:
1. Set the svg style to `overflow: visible` _**(not recommended)**_.
2. Use `boundingBox` as the `viewBox` property of svg element.
3. Translate entire polygon to purely positive plane.
4. Use a simple svg renderer.

Apart from 1, which we not recommend, 2, 3 and 4 can be done easily yourself, or using our built-in utilities.

#### Create svg `viewBox` from `boundingBox`

You can transform a primitive `boundingBox` to svg `viewBox` by:

```tsx
const { x, y, width, height } = boundingBox;

// Can be used as <svg viewBox={viewBox} ...
const viewBox = `${x} ${y} ${width} ${height}`;
```

You can convert the above to a function or use our built-in hook

```tsx
import { useSquare, useSVGViewBox } from "react-use-polygon";

const { boundingBox } = useSquare();

const viewBox = useSVGViewBox(boundingBox);

<svg viewBox={viewBox} />
```

or helper function:

```tsx
import { computeSVGViewBox } from "react-use-polygon";

<svg viewBox={computeSVGViewBox(viewBox)} />
```

:::tip

`boundingBox` of primitive doesw not take into account of line stroke. Hence, when converted to svg `viewBox`, line stroke may only be partially shown.

To fix this issue, you can utilize `padding` props in those function, which will make the box larger to accomodate the line stroke of svg path.

Please refer [useSVGViewBox](/docs/utilities/useSVGViewBox).
