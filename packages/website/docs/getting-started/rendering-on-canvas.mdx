# Rendering on canvas

<ExperimentalWarn name="drawOnCanvas" />

You can too render those primitives on a canvas. The primitive has a built-in callback, `drawOnCanvas`, that serve this exact purpose.

## drawOnCanvas

This callback takes in a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` canvas context and draw primitive on it.

```tsx
// Triangle primitive
const { drawOnCanvas } = useTriangle();

// Canvas ref
const canvasRef = useRef();

// Getting canvas context
const ctx = canvasRef.current.getContext("2d");

// Draw on canvas
drawOnCanvas(ctx);

// Add a stroke or fill or other operation as desired
ctx.stroke(); // or ctx.fill();

// Binding canvas to a ref
<canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
```

:::info

`drawOnCanvas` **does not** handle the drawing cycle for you. It will only draw **once** for each calls.

If you want to constantly animate it, you will need to trigger `drawOnCanvas` on every frame or changes.
